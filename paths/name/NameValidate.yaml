  summary: Validate name data
  description: >-
    Foxentry allows you to check the validity and real existence of names and
    their combinations. At least one parameter is required in the query. You can
    either write down the name separately or use <b>nameSurname</b> as connected
    parameter. <br><br>Pay attention to the query options. Especially
    <b>validationDepth</b>, which determines how strict the validation should be
    based on your use case. For example you''d want minimal validationDepth for
    web forms since you usually don''t want to disturb the user too much with
    error messages and suggestions.   <br><br> Foxentry validator is able not
    only to evaluate the validity of the inputed information but it also can fix
    various typos, errors and missing data. Foxentry can also suggest more
    suitable alternatives to the data sent in query. Please pay attention to the
    <b>result</b>, <b>resultCorrected</b> and <b>suggestions</b> in the
    response.<br><br> Always check <b>result.proposal</b> in the response for a
    proposed solution by Foxentry how you should process the response in your
    form or application.
