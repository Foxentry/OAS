        description: >-
          Specifies the depth of name validation. In other words how strict the
          validator should behave. <b>Minimal</b> = all the names are considered
          valid as long as there are no forbidden characters used or we are 100%
          sure the name is invalid. Usually the only thing corrected is format.
          <b>Moderate</b> = something in between the minimal and strict
          validation. There are more instances of corrections like typos etc.
          <b>Strict</b> = the most strict validation depth. Missing names in our
          database are marked as invalid, the scoring for corrections and
          suggestions is tweaked.
        example: minimal
        default: strict
      smartMode:
        type: boolean
        nullable: true
        description: >-
          Allows to correct the name (resultCorrected). If this is disabled, the
          corrections are given as a suggestion.
