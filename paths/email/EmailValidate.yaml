  summary: Validate email
  description: >-
    This endpoint will let you check if the e-mail address sent in query is
    valid.<br><br> Please pay attention to the <b>validationType</b> option
    since it has direct impact on the returned data. <b>Extended validation</b>
    (default) is the more advanced type that checks the real existence of the
    e-mail address and its deliverability. It also informs you about various
    flags such as <b>freemail and disposable mail</b> detection. <br><br>
    Foxentry validator is able not only to evaluate the validity of the inputed
    information but it also can fix various typos, errors and missing data.
    Foxentry can also suggest more suitable alternatives to the data sent in
    query. Please pay attention to the <b>result</b>, <b>resultCorrected</b> and
    <b>suggestions</b> in the response.<br><br> Always check
    <b>result.proposal</b> in the response for a proposed solution by Foxentry
    how you should process the response in your form or application.
